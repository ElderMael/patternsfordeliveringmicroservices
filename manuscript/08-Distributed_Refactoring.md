# Distributed Refactoring To Ease Drift

## Measure Drive Behavior

The first recommended step to drive convergence is to measure Drift.
But drift is an all-encompassing concept that is also very hard to
measure if you do not divide it on various types of drift.

Here are some of the types of drift that are usual on microservices
architectures regarding platform development.


## Conclusion

The chapter described the reasoning to apply distributed refactoring
and how to measure drift to drive consolidation. The chapter also
explained some of the tools available to apply distributed refactoring
to existing codebases.
